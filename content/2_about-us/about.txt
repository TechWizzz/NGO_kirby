History: 

About a decade earlier, a few souls have gathered together for a good reason – to dedicate their time, resources and skills in reaching out to those women, children and the families in need, irrespective of their caste, creed and status.

Little did that group of dedicated persons knew that today they would be successful running an established NGO, ‘Drishti Foundation Trust’ spread across more than 4 states, having an army of volunteers, touching the lives of thousands of needy women, children & families, based around the belief – to help make this world a better place for the underprivileged.

Drishti Foundation Trust has been helping children from urban slums and other vulnerable communities to move on in life with the means of providing education and healthcare facilities. Drishti Foundation Trust believes in providing all the resources to the needy children to support & direct their childhood in a leading way; by educating & empowering them to help write their own destiny.
